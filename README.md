> Alex Kaylor, Jaime Flores, Jake Butler, Nathan Padgett, Heath Mercer, are collaborating
> to create and implement a simple 2d physics engine.

## General Information
> OLD:This project is designed for users and developers
> such as ourselves interested in learning and implementing an engine such as this from the ground up. Our 
> system will be designed to be intentionally simplified to be accessible to any user and developer to
> understand comprehensively no matter their education.
>
> Update: We decided to pivot from our previous idea of creating a 2d physics engine to implementing a flask app that hosts a number of games in our website. Our website will be able to run each game and display the highest scores for the different games that we currently have available.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Java
- Python
- Flask
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript


## Features
List of ready features here:

- GUI - Simple and intuitive user interface, allowing the user to interact with the engine and its objects.
- Object Drawing - System will draw an object on the plane when recieving input from the user to do so.
	
	>relevant user story(s) to above features: 
    >As a user, I would like to create a window with a 2d plane and a few buttons, that when clicked draw an object.
    >As a developer I want to generate a set of objects that are either static or dynamic.
	

- Dynamics (simple movement) - System will be able to simulate movement on the objects by recieving user input.
- Gravity simulated on objects within 2D plane - System will simulate gravity on all objects in the plane.

	>relevant user story(s): 
    >As a developer, I would like to implement functions in order to change the gravity and velocities of the simulation, so that I can test different scenarios.
    >As a user, I would like a user interface within the window to generate forces upon created objects.
    >As a developer I want to generate a set of objects that are either static or dynamic.

- Plane reset - User will be able to clear the plane of all drawn objects and imposed physics.

    >relevant user story(s): 
    >As a user, I would like the ability to pause/resume the state of the engine to observe individual frames that are displayed.

        - Not merged since this task was to see how the pinball game we have was storing the highscores and would break the layout of the site.

## Next Steps
- **Alex**: "Merge game class and info to work for scoreboard, alter menu to not include game titles, import a handful of games without access to scorekeeping and add details to homepage, look into local database"

- **Nathan**:  "Implementing the backend scoreboard keeping as well as adding in the backend and frontend to a user login in page in order to give logged in users more features" 

- **Heath**: "Import more games and implement a feature for users to upload their own games to website, with security of website as the focus."

- **Jake**

- **Jaime**: "Import another game into our flask app and work in keeping track of scores in the backend or continue to update our front-end."
